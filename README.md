# Dad's 60th Birthday Site

A small static site for a private celebration. Includes a simple sign-in, confetti celebration, date picker to pick a skydive day, and email notification.

## Sign-in
- Username: `cmonell`
- Password: `birthday`

## Run locally
- Open `index.html` directly in a browser.

## Publish to GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repository (public or private) with no template.
2. Push this folder's contents to the repo root (keep `index.html` at the root).
3. In the repo settings, under Pages, set Source to `Deploy from a branch`, then choose your default branch and `/ (root)`.
4. Save. Pages will publish in a minute.

If you prefer a `gh-pages` branch:
- Create and push a `gh-pages` branch and set Pages to publish from `gh-pages` root.

No build step is required.

## Access the site (GitHub Pages URL)
- After publishing, your site will be available at:
  - `https://<your-username>.github.io/dad_60th_birthday/`
  - For organizations: `https://<your-org>.github.io/dad_60th_birthday/`
- You can also copy the exact URL shown in the repository: `Settings` → `Pages` → `Your site is live at ...`.
